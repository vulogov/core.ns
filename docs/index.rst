**core.NS** - Application Framework for Python with a Unix as its grandfather.
==============================================================================

.. caution::
	core.NS is in constant state of development and improvement. While I am striving to keep backward compatibility the best I could, please pay close attention to :ref:`"What's New" <whatsnew>`  chapter if the documentation.

There are many Python Application Frameworks and when I am to introduce you another one, called core.NS.
