Namespace
=========

.. note::
	core.NS ZEN rule #2 - Well regulated namespace of the data and code elements are more manageable and comprehensible, then an artificial maze of the objects and cryptic defaults for the local and global variables. In a Namespace, you can't be wrong, because, what's you place in the element defined by the path, that's what you get. All the time.
